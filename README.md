# Vanilla JS Infinite Scroll using Resize Observer and Web Animation API

This is an example of building an indefinately scrolling list of items using the Web Animation API and Resize Observer.

It supports:

- an arbitrary amount of slides on a single page, just add `data-slides-wrapper` to each sliders' root element
- data attributes to configure duration and direction:
- if needed, it clones slides until the wrapper's width is filled
